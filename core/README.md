**NSFW**
--------

Parrot do have NSFW commands, but those are HIDDEN from \`help\` command on purpose.

Those commands are only for mature audience (STRICTLY 18 or above). **I as a bot owner, if found anyone who is below 18 using NSFW commands, will be permanently banned from using Parrot and reported to rightful authority.**

Since the commands are hidden, it is still possible to use them. But you need to know the command name.

[List of NSFW commands](https://github.com/rtk-rnjn/Parrot/blob/main/cogs/nsfw/_nsfw.py)

> NSFW commands are only available in NSFW channels.
> 
> The commands rely on third-party services, if bot not responding or delays in responding, it's surely not us but the API.
